This code is designed to take an xlsx file from Quickbooks that has all customer contact information and generate a single xlsx file that has Client, Name & Email with only unique emails being kept. 

DOWNLOAD FILE FROM QB AND SAVE IT TO WORKING DIRECTORY -- REPORT: CUSTOMER CONTACT LIST
You'll need to download the file from QuickBooks and save it in your working directory.

CHANGE FILE NAME
In the script, the file name is used twice. Once to read in the file and once ot save it out. You'll need to change the placeholder to the actual name of your xlsx file that you want to read in and then what you want to save it as. 

Doesn't get much simpler than this. If you see something I can improve upon, please let me konw. This is my first code to upload to GitHub!
